# üåç pyquadkey2
[![Documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyquadkey2/badge/?version=latest)](https://pyquadkey2.readthedocs.io)

This is a feature-rich Python implementation of [QuadKeys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system), an approach to **geographical tiling**, that was proposed by Microsoft to be used for Bing Maps.

In essence, the concept is to **recursively** divide the flat, two-dimensional world map into squares. Each square contains **four squares** as children, which again contain four squares and so on, up **centimeter-level precision**. Each of these squares is **uniquely identifiable with a string** like `021030032`.

For more details on the concept, please refer to the [original article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system).

[n1try/pyquadkey2](https://github.com/n1try/pyquadkey2) originates from a **fork** of [buckhx/QuadKey](https://github.com/buckhx/QuadKey), which is not maintained anymore. It build on top of that project and adds:

* ‚úÖ Several (critical) [bug fixes](https://github.com/buckhx/QuadKey/pull/15)
* ‚úÖ Python 3 support
* ‚úÖ [Type hints](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/typing.html) for all methods
* ‚úÖ Higher test coverage
* ‚úÖ Cython backend for improved performance
* ‚úÖ 64-bit integer representation of QuadKeys
* ‚úÖ Additional features and convenience methods

## Installation
### Requirements
This library requires **Python 3.6** or higher. To compile it by yourself, Cython is required in addition.

### Using Pip
* `pip3 install pyquadkey2`

Currently, there are pre-built `linux_x86_64` for Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. If you're on a Linux system, you can simply use pip without any additional requirements.
On other systems, you might need to install Cython first (`pip3 install cython`). If you encounter problems while installing, please report them as a new issue.

### From Source
* `git clone https://github.com/n1try/pyquadkey2`
* `pip3 install cython`
* `cd pyquadkey2/quadkey/tilesystem && python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace && ../../`
* `pip3 install .`

### Troubleshooting
* `ImportError: cannot import name 'tilesystem'`: Simply try `pip3 install --upgrade pyquadkey2` once again. Second time usually works, as required build extensions are installed then. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the future.
